# Connect Four ♦️

[Connect Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four) is a game I enjoyed playing with my friends, now it is available to play right in your terminal. 

Stay tuned...



## Setup

WIP



## How to play

1. Select a game mode
   1. Mode [1]: Player vs Player
   2. Mode [2]: Player vs Computer (Coming soon!)
2. The game will randomly decide who goes first
3. Player will each take turn to drop a coloured disc into a column
4. To drop the coloured disc, enter a column number between 1 to 7
5. Try to connect four of your discs in a row up and down (vertical), side to side (horizontal), or diagonally
6. The first player to get four of their coloured discs in a row wins! 
   If the whole grid fills up and no one has four in a row, the game is a tie.
